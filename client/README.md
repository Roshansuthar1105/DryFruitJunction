## 🌟 Brand Story

**“A Sweet Revolution from the Heart of Rajasthan”**

DryFruit Junction was born not from a factory, but from our family-run kitchen in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. A brand that blends purity, premium dry fruits, and the richness of handmade tradition. From our signature Besan Chakki to exotic flavors like Mango and Strawberry Kaju Katli, we redefine what real mithai means.

We bring trust, taste, and tradition—one sweet at a time.
